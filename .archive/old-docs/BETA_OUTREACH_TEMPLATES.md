## Template 1: Facebook Group Post (Value First)

**Subject**: Free beta access: Automated repricing for book sellers

---

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been selling books on Amazon/eBay for [X years/months] and got frustrated with manual repricing. I'd spend hours every week checking competitor prices and updating my listings.

So I built a tool that automates it.

**What it does:**
✅ Automatically adjusts your prices based on competitors (hourly)
✅ Works on Amazon FBA/FBM and eBay
✅ 4 pricing strategies (match lowest, undercut by %, target margin, etc.)
✅ Sets price floors/ceilings so you don't lose money
✅ Tracks all price changes with history

**Looking for 10-15 beta testers** who:
- Sell books on Amazon or eBay
- Have at least 50+ active listings
- Can give honest feedback
- Will actually use it for 2-3 weeks

**What's in it for you:**
- Free access during beta (normally $29-49/month)
- 50% lifetime discount if you like it
- Early input on features
- Save time on repricing

**Not looking for:**
- Tire kickers who sign up but never test
- People who expect perfection (it's beta!)

If you're interested, comment below or DM me. I'll send you the link and setup guide.

Would love to hear if this is something you'd find useful!

## Template 2: Reddit Post (r/Flipping, r/FulfillmentByAmazon)

**Title**: [Beta Testers Wanted] Automated repricing tool for book sellers

---

I've been flipping books for the past [X years] and built a tool to solve my own problem: manual repricing sucks.

**The problem:**
- Checking competitor prices daily/weekly is tedious
- Manual updates take forever
- You lose sales when overpriced, money when underpriced

**What I built:**
An automated repricing engine that:
- Runs hourly and adjusts your Amazon/eBay listings
- Multiple strategies (match lowest, beat by X%, target margin)
- Price bounds so you don't race to the bottom
- Works while you sleep

**Looking for beta testers:**
- Must have 50+ book listings on Amazon or eBay
- Willing to test for 2-3 weeks
- Give honest feedback (bugs, features, would you pay for this?)

**What you get:**
- Free during beta
- 50% lifetime discount if you convert
- Help shape the product

**What I need:**
- Your honest opinion
- Bug reports if things break
- Answer: "Would you pay $X/month for this?"

This isn't a side project I'll abandon. I'm using it myself daily. Just want to validate if others find it valuable before I invest in marketing/growth.

Comment or DM if interested. Happy to answer questions.

*(Mods: Please remove if this violates rules - not trying to spam, genuinely looking for testers)*

## Template 3: Direct Message (To Individuals)

**Subject**: Saw your post about [repricing/book selling] - can I get your feedback?

---

Hi [Name],

I saw your comment/post in [group/subreddit] about [specific pain point they mentioned].

I've been working on a tool that might solve this - it's an automated repricing engine for book sellers that works on Amazon FBA/FBM and eBay.

**Basically:**
- Set your pricing strategy (match lowest, undercut by X%, etc.)
- It runs hourly and auto-updates your listings
- You set min/max bounds so it never races to the bottom
- Complete price change history

I'm looking for 10-15 book sellers to test it for 2-3 weeks and give me honest feedback. In exchange:
- Free access during beta
- 50% lifetime discount if you like it
- Early input on features

**Would you be interested?** No pressure either way - I'm just trying to validate if this solves a real problem or if it's just me.

If yes, I'll send you the link + quick setup guide (takes ~10 mins to connect your Amazon/eBay account).

Thanks!
[Your Name]

P.S. How many book listings do you currently manage? Just curious about the scale.

**Here's what to do now:**

1. **Watch this quick start video** (3 minutes): [Link]

2. **Connect your Amazon/eBay API credentials**: [Setup Guide Link]
   - Don't worry, it's secure (we only need read/write access for listings)
   - Takes ~10 minutes

3. **Create your first repricing rule**:
   - Go to Repricing page
   - Select platform (Amazon/eBay)
   - Choose strategy (I recommend "Beat by 5%" to start)
   - Set your min/max price bounds
   - Activate it

4. **Join the beta Discord/Slack**: [Invite Link]
   - Ask questions
   - Report bugs
   - Share feedback

**What I need from you:**

- **Week 1**: Get set up, create a rule, let it run
- **Week 2**: Check if prices are updating correctly
- **Week 3**: Tell me - would you pay for this? How much?

**A few questions for you:**

1. How many book listings do you currently have?
2. What tools do you use today for repricing?
3. How much time do you spend on manual repricing per week?

(Just reply to this email - helps me understand your needs)

**Any issues?**
Email me or ping me in Discord. I'm here to help.

Thanks again for testing!

Hi [Name],

You've been testing ISBNScout for ~3 weeks now. First, **thank you!** Your feedback has been super valuable.

**I have one final question:**

**If ISBNScout cost $29/month, would you subscribe?**

☐ Yes, I'd pay $29/month
☐ Yes, but only if it cost $[X]/month
☐ Maybe - depends on [what feature/improvement?]
☐ No, because [why not?]

**Honest answers help me decide if this is worth building.**

If you said yes or maybe, you'll get **50% off for life** as a thank you for being an early tester ($14.50/month forever).

**Regardless of your answer**, I really appreciate you taking the time to test this.

Reply with your answer whenever you get a chance!

Thanks,

✅ Respond to every comment/DM within 24 hours

✅ Follow up (gently) if they ghost after signing up

### DON'T:
❌ Spam every group at once
❌ Ignore community rules
❌ Oversell ("REVOLUTIONARY TOOL!!!")
❌ Get defensive about negative feedback
❌ Give up after first post gets no responses

### Timing:
- **Best days**: Tuesday-Thursday

- Day 21: "Would you pay for this?"
- Day 28: Final survey + thank you

## Objection Handling

**"I don't have time to test this"**
→ "No problem! Takes 10 minutes to set up, then it runs automatically. Would next week work better?"

**"I'm worried about giving API access"**
→ "Totally understand. We only request listing read/write permissions (same as any repricing tool). API keys are encrypted. Happy to show you the code if you're technical."

**"I already use [Tool X]"**
→ "Nice! What do you like about it? What do you wish it did better? [Honestly trying to learn]"

**"What if it sets my prices too low?"**
→ "You set min/max price bounds - it'll never go below your minimum. You're always in control."

**"I'm not a power seller, I only have 30 listings"**
→ "That's fine! Even 30 listings take time to reprice manually. You're exactly who I want feedback from."

**"How do I know you won't abandon this?"**
→ "I'm using it myself daily for my own book business. Happy to show you my listings as proof."

## Response Tracking

Keep track in a spreadsheet:

| Name | Source | Date | Status | Would Pay? | Max Price | Next Follow-Up |
|------|--------|------|--------|------------|-----------|----------------|
| John | FB Group | 11/17 | Signed up | TBD | TBD | 11/24 |
| Sarah | Reddit | 11/18 | Interested | TBD | TBD | 11/20 |

**Status Options:**
- Interested (replied to post)
- Signed Up (received access)
- Active (using it)
- Inactive (signed up, never used)
- Feedback (gave survey response)
- Converted (willing to pay)
- Lost (not interested anymore)

---

## Reality Check

**Expected conversion:**
- 100 people see your post
- 10-20 people comment/DM (10-20%)
- 5-10 people actually sign up (5-10%)
- 3-5 people actively use it (3-5%)
- 1-2 people would pay (1-2%)

**That's normal.** You need to reach 500-1000 people to get 10 active beta testers.

**Don't get discouraged.** Keep posting, keep following up, keep improving the product based on feedback.

One paying customer proves the concept. Five paying customers = you have a business.
