## Phase 3: Testing & Feedback (Week 3-4)

### Beta Tester Onboarding
1. Send welcome email with:
   - Quick start video
   - API credentials setup guide
   - Discord/Slack invite
   - What you need from them (weekly feedback, bug reports)

2. Schedule kickoff call (optional, but builds relationship)

3. Check-in schedule:
   - Day 3: "Any issues getting set up?"
   - Day 7: "Have you tried the repricing yet?"
   - Day 14: "Would you pay for this? How much?"
   - Day 21: "What's the ONE feature we need to add?"

### Key Questions to Validate

**Usage Questions:**
1. How many books do you currently have listed?
2. What tools do you currently use? How much do they cost?
3. Did the repricing engine work correctly?
4. How much time did this save you vs. manual repricing?
5. Did you see any sales increase from repricing?

**Pricing Questions:**
6. Would you pay for this? (Yes/No)
7. What's the max you'd pay per month? ($15/$29/$49/$99)
8. What's missing that would make you upgrade to a paid plan?

**Product Questions:**
9. What feature did you use most?
10. What feature needs the most work?
11. What would you add if you had a magic wand?

### Success Criteria

**Minimum Viable Success:**
- 10+ beta testers sign up
- 5+ actually use it for 2+ weeks
- 3+ say they'd pay $29/month or more
- 0 major bugs that block usage

**Strong Validation:**
- 15+ beta testers
- 8+ active for 2+ weeks
- 5+ willing to pay $29-49/month
- 2+ measurable results (sales increase, time saved)

**Kill It Signals:**
- Can't get 10 people interested
- Repricing doesn't work with real APIs
- No one would pay more than $10/month
- Everyone abandons after first week

---

## Phase 4: Decision Point (End of Week 4)

### If Validation Succeeds:
1. Convert beta testers to paying customers (50% lifetime discount)
2. Build mobile app or improve web experience
3. Set launch date (2-3 months)
4. Start building email list via landing page

### If Validation Fails:
1. Analyze why (product? market? messaging?)
2. Decide: Pivot or kill
3. Share learnings publicly (builds credibility for next project)

---

## Resources Needed

### Time Investment
- Week 1: 20-30 hours (prep)
- Week 2: 10-15 hours (outreach)
- Week 3-4: 5-10 hours/week (support)
- **Total: 40-60 hours over 4 weeks**

### Tools
- [ ] Discord or Slack (free tier)
- [ ] Typeform or Google Forms (free)
- [ ] Loom for video (free)
- [ ] Real Amazon/eBay API credentials (already have?)
- [ ] Beta testing domain/subdomain (optional)

### Budget
- **$0 if you do everything yourself**
- Optional: $100-200 for Facebook ads to boost posts
- Optional: $50 for landing page template (Gumroad/Carrd)

---

## Red Flags to Watch For

1. **No one responds to outreach** → Messaging is wrong or market doesn't exist
2. **People sign up but don't use it** → Onboarding is bad or product isn't valuable
3. **Repricing fails with real APIs** → Core value prop doesn't work, rebuild or pivot
4. **Everyone loves it but won't pay** → Pricing is wrong or features aren't complete
5. **Only friends/family test it** → Not reaching real target market

---

## Next Steps Right Now

1. **THIS WEEK**: Test repricing with real Amazon/eBay accounts
2. **THIS WEEK**: Write outreach post (use template below)
3. **THIS WEEK**: Join 5-7 Facebook groups and Reddit communities
4. **NEXT WEEK**: Post in 3-4 communities
5. **TRACK**: Responses in a spreadsheet (name, source, status)

---

## Tracking Spreadsheet Template

Create a Google Sheet with these columns:
- Name
- Email
- Source (Facebook/Reddit/etc.)
- Date Contacted
- Status (Interested/Signed Up/Active/Inactive/Converted)
- Feedback Summary
- Would Pay? (Y/N)
- Max Price ($)
- Notes

---

## Success Stories = Social Proof

If even ONE person gets results:
- Sales increased 15% from automated repricing
- Saved 5 hours/week on manual price updates
- Sold 3 books that were overpriced before

**→ That's your marketing message**
**→ That's proof it works**
**→ That's how you get the next 100 customers**

---

## Remember

**You're not selling software. You're selling:**
- Time back (less manual work)
- More profit (better pricing strategy)
- Peace of mind (automated, not forgotten)

**The goal isn't perfection. The goal is validation.**

Get 3-5 people saying "Yes, I'd pay for this" and you have a business.
