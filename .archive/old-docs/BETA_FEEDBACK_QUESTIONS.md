## Analyzing Feedback

### Red Flags 🚩
- "I haven't had time to try it" (from 5+ people) → Bad onboarding or not valuable
- "It's cool but I wouldn't pay" → Pricing mismatch or insufficient value
- "It broke my listings" → Critical bug, fix immediately
- "I prefer [competitor]" → Need to understand why
- No one finishes setup → Onboarding is broken

### Green Flags 🎉
- "This saved me X hours/week" → Clear value prop
- "I'd pay $X for this" (where X ≥ your target) → Pricing validated
- "When can I buy this?" → Strong demand signal
- "I told my friend about it" → Word of mouth potential
- Specific feature requests → They're engaged and thinking about it

### Decision Matrix

| Feedback Pattern | What It Means | Action |
|------------------|---------------|---------|
| 10+ sign-ups, 0 active users | Bad onboarding | Fix setup process |
| 5+ active users, none would pay | Pricing too high or value too low | Adjust price or add features |
| 3+ would pay $29+/month | Strong validation | Launch! |
| Major bugs reported | Product not ready | Fix before continuing outreach |
| "It's fine but..." | Lukewarm, needs hook | Find the killer feature |

## Remember

**You're not looking for perfection. You're looking for signal.**

**Strong Signal = People say:**
- "When can I buy this?"
- "This saved me X hours"
- "I'd pay $Y for this"
- "I told my friend about it"

**Weak Signal = People say:**
- "It's interesting"
- "I might use it"
- "It's cool but..."
- "Maybe if it had X"

Get 3-5 strong signals → You have a business.
Get 0 strong signals after 10 testers → Time to pivot or kill.
