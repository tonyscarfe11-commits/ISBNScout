**Subject**: Looking for beta testers - Automated repricing for book sellers (free during beta)

Hey everyone! 👋

I've been selling books on Amazon/eBay and got frustrated spending hours every week manually checking competitor prices and updating my listings.

So I built a tool to automate it.

**What it does:**
✅ Automatically adjusts your prices based on competitors (hourly)
✅ Works on Amazon FBA/FBM and eBay
✅ 4 pricing strategies (match lowest, undercut by %, etc.)
✅ Sets min/max price bounds so you don't race to the bottom
✅ Tracks all price changes with history

**Looking for 10 beta testers who:**
- Sell books on Amazon or eBay (at least 50+ listings)
- Can test for 2-3 weeks
- Will give honest feedback

**What you get:**
- Free access during beta
- 50% lifetime discount if you like it
- Early input on features

Comment or DM if interested - I'll send you the setup link.

Would love feedback on whether this is actually useful or if I'm solving a problem that doesn't exist!

---

**Note**: Customize this with your own voice. Add a line about how many books YOU sell, or a specific pain point you faced.

---

## ⚠️ Before You Start Outreach

### CRITICAL: Test the repricing engine first

**You MUST do this before inviting testers:**

1. Set up real Amazon/eBay API credentials
2. Create a repricing rule for one of YOUR books
3. Wait for it to run (or trigger manually)
4. Check if:
   - Competitor price was fetched correctly
   - New price was calculated correctly
   - Listing was updated on Amazon/eBay
   - History was logged

**If this doesn't work, FIX IT FIRST.**

Inviting testers to a broken product = burnt bridges.

---

## 📊 Decision Points

### After Week 1:
**If < 5 people signed up** → Improve messaging or try different communities
**If 5-10 signed up** → Good! Keep going
**If 10+ signed up** → Great! Focus on onboarding

### After Week 2:
**If 0 people used it** → Onboarding is broken, fix it
**If 2-3 active users** → Good! Get feedback
**If 5+ active users** → Excellent! Start asking about pricing

### After Week 3:
**If 0 would pay** → Wrong market or insufficient value
**If 1-2 would pay $29+** → Weak signal, keep improving
**If 3+ would pay $29+** → STRONG SIGNAL → Launch!

### After Week 4:
**LAUNCH or PIVOT or KILL**

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Posting Strategy
- Post Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am or 7-9pm
- Don't spam all groups at once (spread over 3-4 days)
- Respond to EVERY comment within 24 hours
- Be helpful even to people who don't sign up

### Messaging Strategy
- Lead with pain point, not features
- "Stop spending hours on manual repricing" > "4 pricing strategies"
- Show, don't tell (screenshot of repricing history)
- Be humble: "Would love feedback on if this is useful"

### Follow-Up Strategy
- Day 3: "Any issues getting set up?"
- Day 7: "Has it worked for you?"
- Day 14: "What do you think so far?"
- Day 21: "Would you pay for this?"

### Red Flags to Watch
- No one responds to outreach → Wrong messaging/audience
- Sign up but never use → Bad onboarding
- Use it once, never again → Not valuable enough
- Love it but won't pay → Pricing mismatch

## 🎯 Your North Star

**You only need ONE person to say:**

> "This saved me 5 hours last week. Where do I pay?"

That's validation.

That's proof people will pay.

That's your green light to keep building.

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. Read BETA_VALIDATION_PLAN.md (full strategy)
2. Test repricing engine TODAY
3. Join Facebook groups today
4. Post first outreach tomorrow
5. Email me your first tester sign-up 🎉

## ❓ Questions?

Common concerns:

**"What if no one responds?"**
→ Try different messaging, different communities. Iterate.

**"What if they hate it?"**
→ Better to know now than after 6 months of building.

**"What if I can't get 10 testers?"**
→ Even 3-5 real users give you valuable data.

**"What if repricing doesn't work?"**
→ Fix it before outreach. This is your core value prop.

---

## 🏁 Final Thought

**You've built something impressive.** The architecture is solid. The features are comprehensive.

**But none of that matters if people won't pay for it.**

These next 4 weeks will tell you if this is a business or a learning project.

**Either outcome is valuable.**

- If it works → You have a $3-10K/month SaaS business
- If it doesn't → You learned, and you move to the next idea

**The only failure is not testing it.**

Go find your first beta tester.

Good luck! 🚀
